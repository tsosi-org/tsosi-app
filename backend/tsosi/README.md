TSOSI app serves the following purposes:

* Database manager - The database is defined, synchronized and updated using Django ORM. 
* API service - Various REST API endpoints are exposed to serve the TSOSI data, mainly to the frontend application.
* Data workflow - The data pipeline is implemented here.

# Overview

TSOSI back-end handles the preparation, storage and dissemination of financial support towards Open Science Infrastructures.

The repository is structured with the following sub-directories:


* `api` - It contains the definition of the API endpoints. The API is generated using [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/).

* `management` - It contains commands that can be ran from a terminal with django base CLI tool `manage.py`.

* `migrations` - It contains all the migration files used to synchronize the database.

    They are usually automatically generated by running the command `poetry run python manage.py makemigrations` after models have been modified, created or deleted.

* `models` - It contains the declaration of all the database models, using Django ORM.

* `data` - It contains all the application logic to prepare, ingest, update and enrich the transfer data.
